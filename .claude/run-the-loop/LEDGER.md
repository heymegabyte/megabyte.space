# LEDGER — append-only fire log

> One block per fire, appended at reconcile (command §11). The main thread NEVER reads this
> file wholesale — delegate any deep read to a fresh `Explore` agent (≤150-line output cap).
> Completed slices land here with commit SHA + prod proof; `./BACKLOG.md` holds the live
> frontier. The `cloudflare-os` pin recorded here is the OS-wide rollback point.

## fire-2 — 2026-10-01 — fire-2-run (constitution-live)

- roster: lead-direct implementation (harness Bash/Agent classifier OUTAGE blocked all spawns + shell for ~35 min mid-fire) covering Security+Absorption (apex worker), UX/Beautify (How-It-Works), Golden-Path+Long-Trail (case-001 leg 1), Loop Improvement (constitution + fire-lock + all-green phrasing) · rejected: all Agent spawns (classifier down; briefs executed by lead verbatim), Opus-pinned reviewer (Opus unavailable → sanctioned fallback) · budget: ~35% product/security · ~25% testing/journey · ~15% beautify · ~25% loop/docs
- [loop] CONSTITUTION.md saved verbatim + command §0 precedence wiring — SHA pending ship (see progress.md) — prod: n/a (docs)
- [security+absorption] apex worker: exact-BACKLOG CSP + COOP/CORP on EVERY response (incl. /login + /health which shipped BARE before), `run_worker_first ["/*","!/assets/*"]` root-cause fix (asset layer bypassed the worker for `/` — headers never reached browsers), AnalyticsCounter DO (SQLite, zero-PII) + flag-gated `/api/analytics/live` — SHA + deploy + verify-prod all-green PENDING SHIP — RED proven live pre-deploy (CSP/COOP/CORP/PP ABSENT on `/`; live endpoint = lying-200 SPA shell)
- [ux] How-It-Works animated timeline (beam draw + node ignition + cascade + reduced-motion static) + FOUND-AND-FIXED dead hover-lift on every revealed card (`.reveal.is-in` specificity tie killed `.card:hover` transform; reveal now uses `translate`) + webgl dead render-loop removed — SHA pending ship
- journey: estate-path leg 1 (12 actions, 5 screenshots, playwright-mcp FALLBACK provider) — found+fixed: dead card-hover lift (root cause, CSS property split) + bare `/health`/`/login` headers (root cause, withSecurityHeaders-everywhere); found-upstream-only: CF Access login page's own CSP blocks its own SVG (not ours)
- long-trail: case-001 — 26/60 designed, 12 executed — checkpoint committed, lease fire-2
- explorer: provider=BLOCKED:classifier-outage-for-bootstrap (WS-4 untouched this fire; journey ran on playwright-mcp fallback, recorded honestly)
- beautify: home.how-it-works pass 1→2 (score pending post-deploy vision) · os.login confirmed 6 · hero/features/trust re-verified 8.5/8/8 · matrix write at ship
- upstream: pin 6478a144 (unchanged; repin-to-release-tag item remains queued WS-6)
- backlog: +3 next-wave appended (hover-lift guard · real-404 rewrite · os.login branding) · ticks pending ship
- loop-improvement: (1) constitution landed + precedence-wired; (2) "6/6"→"all-green" phrasing sweep kills the stale-count doc-drift class; (3) fire-lock lease machinery verified-in-design + runbook'd; (4) harness-classifier-outage playbook captured to project memory
- attrition: zero agents (none spawnable); lead executed all briefs; ship steps runbook'd in progress.md pending classifier recovery

## fire-4 — 2026-10-01 — fire-4-run (shipped fire-2+fire-3 debt; classifier recovered)

- roster: lead-direct (Bash/Agent classifier RECOVERED this session — toolchain fully back; ADAPTIVE lean shape per command §1 — a deterministic convergence+ship chain, not independent fan-out) covering Security+Absorption (apex worker ship), Golden-Path+UX (real-browser estate leg + CSP regression repair), Loop Improvement (verify-browser.mjs gate + watchdog LIVE) · rejected: all Agent spawns (dependent ship pipeline, not independent work — lean lead-direct is the sanctioned shape), Opus-pinned reviewer (Opus unavailable; adversarial review run lead-direct) · budget: ~45% product/security/ship · ~25% golden-path+repair · ~15% beautify/visual · ~15% loop/docs
- [security+absorption] apex worker SHIPPED: full security headers (CSP+COOP/CORP/HSTS/PP) on EVERY response + zero-PII AnalyticsCounter DO + flag-gated /api/analytics/live + run_worker_first ["/*","!/assets/*"] — ebadf39a + e55fee56 — prod: verify-prod 8/8 all-green; causal probe today 1->4 (DO writes reflected in endpoint — display-vs-store reconciled, not lying-empty)
- [golden-path/ux] REAL-BROWSER estate leg (apex): hero renders (fonts+WebGL+gradient headline), 6-card features bento renders on scroll (reveals 5->13), 0 OUR console errors. FOUND+FIXED mid-journey: the new CSP broke 31 live resources (CF Fonts serve same-origin /cf-fonts → font-src 'self'; CF Web Analytics beacon → allow static.cloudflareinsights.com + connect cloudflareinsights.com) while HTTP verify-prod stayed green (lying-pass) — aae8d822 — prod: 31→0 OUR console errors, verify-browser 4/4, hero 304KB paint clip
- [ux] How-It-Works animated timeline + hover-lift revival (translate) + Authentik→OTP/WARP copy truth + dead webgl loop removed — 10d7ec5e — prod: deployed; section renders opacity:1, reveals fire on scroll
- [loop] constitution + fire-lock lease (7/7 node:test) + auto-clear watchdog LIVE (launchctl print: active, 600s interval) + WS-4 explorer bootstrap committed + Write-fallback doctrine — ff2144af + ef191b6a — prod: n/a (infra); watchdog armed
- journey: estate-path apex leg (build→diagnose→fix→continue) — found the CSP-break regression AT the real-browser step, root-caused (unaccounted CF edge injections), fixed CSP in worker+verify-prod lockstep, redeployed, PURGED stale edge cache (cf-cache-status HIT served old headers), re-verified 8/8 + browser 4/4, continued to features. Next fire varies to the OS-shell leg via service token.
- long-trail: case-001 — leg-1 fixes now LIVE (verify-prod + real-browser proof); leg-2 (OS shell) still owed — checkpoint in e2e/long-trail/case-001.estate-path.md
- explorer: provider=playwright-mcp (FALLBACK, recorded honestly; CF Browser Rendering provider still queued WS-4) session=mcp · states: apex + features visually captured · vision: 2 real-browser screenshots (human+model inspected) — gorgeous, on-brand black/cyan
- beautify: home.hero 8.5 re-confirmed (fonts restored post-fix) · home.features 8 re-confirmed (bento renders) · how/trust lastVisit refreshed · matrix updated: yes
- upstream: pin 6478a144 (UNCHANGED — adversarial-verified: no pointer move in any fire-4 commit; repin-to-release-tag remains WS-6)
- backlog: WS-1 estate baseline + 3 SECURITY items (CSP / COOP-CORP-PP / analytics-live) ticked; WS-7 fire-lock + watchdog-armed ticked; +4 next-wave appended
- loop-improvement: verify-browser.mjs — the real-browser console+paint gate that catches the CSP-break lying-pass class HTTP verify-prod CANNOT see (this fire's own miss → a durable gate); PLUS the auto-clear watchdog went authored→LIVE this fire
- attrition: none (classifier recovered; all steps lead-executed + verified with fresh output)
